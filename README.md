## How It's made:

**Tech used:** html, JavaScript, CSS, bootstrap, github pages cPanel, and, formsubmit api

## Optimizations
In the future, I could make the project tiles more interactive

## Lessons Learned:
This is the first site I ever made. The first version went live in 2021, I've made a lot of changes since then.
Over the years, I learned a lot about:
- Figma it was a great tool for wire firing I didn't know what I wanted the site to look like, so went through a lot of iterations.
- how to set up and maintain web server.
- how to use git and GitHub.
- how to use CSS to make a responsive design.
